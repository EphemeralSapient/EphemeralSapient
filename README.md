# 👋 Hello, I'm EphemeralSapient, and also I go by "semp" 

Welcome to my stupid account! I have repositories that I create and maintain for a while, only to let them sink into dormancy for quite some time. One day, perhaps, I will attain the perfection of a complete project

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Flutter, C++, Python, Lua, Java, JavaScript
- **Preferred OS**: Arch Linux 🐧 [ I use arch btw ]
- **Favorite Window Manager**: i3, KDE [ I am not lying ] 
- **Side note**, I maintain yet another account for codebase in replit : https://replit.com/@sempit
  
## What I Do

- Building beautiful UIs swiftly with Flutter 🎨
- Optimizing and fine-tuning code for peak performance by spending considerable amount of time
- Wonder why I keep compiling the open source programs when I can use pre-built binaries
- Discord is my communication hub - find me as **semp1337**, sounds silly?

## 🌱 Learning & Exploring

- Currently delving into React ⚛️ 
- Previous experience with ROBLOX Lua scripting and Zoho Deluge for Zobot scripting 🤖 [ and maybe for long time, I may not bother with these ]

## College Life
Balancing academic pursuits with a passion for technology. Constantly seeking opportunities to apply and enhance my knowledge. Maybe not.

## Collaboration
I'm always open to collaboration and discussions. Feel free to reach out on Discord.
